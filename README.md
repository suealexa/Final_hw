I found two unexpected phenomena in the Citibike data.

One was that there was an extreme outlier in birth years.  An astonishing number of people were born in 1969.  I expected most of the people to claim this to be men but instead they chose unknown gender. The majority of them were short term customers so I guess people only try to be funny if they're anonymous.  It does remind me that context is really important when analyzing data.  None of the foreign students in the class were able to make sense of the outlier.

The other surprise for me was that short term and long term users had the same use pattern by day of the week.  I expected to see short term users be heavy weekend users since I assumed they were visitors to New York.  There was also no difference in male versus female day of use.
